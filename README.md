Variables Understanding
* SulphurDioxide SO_2: Sulfur dioxide (SO2) enters the Earth's atmosphere through both natural and anthropogenic processes. It plays a role in chemistry on a local and global scale and its impact ranges from short-term pollution to effects on climate. Only about 30% of the emitted SO2 comes from natural sources; the majority is of anthropogenic (human made) origin.
